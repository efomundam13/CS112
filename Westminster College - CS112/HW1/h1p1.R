# Description: Write code that sets the variables years, days, hours, minutes 
# and seconds to the equivalent time length in years, days, hours, minutes 
# and seconds

#secondsconverter <- function(seconds){
  
#  years <- seconds %/% 31536000
#  seconds <- seconds - (years * 31536000)
  
#  days <- seconds %/% 86400
#  seconds <- seconds - (days * 86400)
  
#  hours <- seconds %/% 3600
#  seconds <- seconds - (hours * 3600)
  
#  minutes <- seconds %/% 60
#  seconds <- seconds - (minutes * 60)
  
#  seconds <- seconds %% 60
  
#  cat(paste("Years: ", years, "\n",
#            "Days: ", days, "\n",
#            "Hours: ", hours, "\n",
#            "Minutes: ", minutes, "\n",
