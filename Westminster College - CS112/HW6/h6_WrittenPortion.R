# Homework 6, Problem 1
# Indicate whether each of the following expressions evaluates to a list, 
# a vector or an error. If an expression evaluates to a vector shown the vector.
# If it evaluates to a list specify the number of components in the list.
# a. x[1]
    "a" "e" "i" "o" "u"
# b. x[[1]]
    "a" "e" "i" "o" "u"
# c. x[1:2]
    "a" "e" "i" "o" "u"
    1 3 2
# d.x[x[[2]]]
    "a" "e" "i" "o" "u"
    5  3  1 -1 -3 -5
    1 3 2
# e.x[x[[2]]][2]
    5  3  1 -1 -3 -5
# f.x[[1]][x[[2]]]
    "a" "i" "e"

#Homework 6, Problem 2
# a. Show how you can assign the names vowels, vector and sequence to the 
# components of the list x in the previous problem.
names(x) <- c("vowels", "vector", "sequence")

# b. Which two of the following return the same value: x[1], x[[1]], x["vowels"]
x[1] and x["vowels"]

# c. Show two different ways to access the "e" in the first component
x[1][[1]][2] and x[["vowels"]][2]

#Homework 6, Problem 3
# a. Show how to create a data frame called pacolleges which stores this data.
